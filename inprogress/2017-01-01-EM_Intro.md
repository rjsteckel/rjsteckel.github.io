@def title = "EM Introduction"

EM is a, relatively, old algorithm for parameter inference when the observed data is incomplete. This typically means that a model structure is assumed, but some variables in the model that interact with observed variables must be inferred. The idea is built on basic theorem in probability, Jenson's Inequality:

For a convex function, f, 

f(E[X]) < E[f(X)]

So the expected value of a convex function is greater than the function evaluated at the expected value. The idea of EM is to use this iteratively. Estimate the parameter
