Brewing beer has been a hobby of mine for over five years now. It can be a lot of work, yet fun at the same time. I started brewing with a simple one gallon IPA kit. When the beer was finished and it tasted pretty good, I wanted to do another batch. The logical next step seemed to be that I visit my local homebrew shop. They were extremely helpful. There are a lot of variables in brewing beer. The ingredients, measurements, temperatures and times all affect the final product. But, when you're just starting out, I think it's best to understand the process. To me, this process has three main steps, mashing, boiling and fermenting. 

## Mashing

Mashing is the process of turning malted barley (and other cereal grains) into a sugary liquid called "wort". The malting of a grain is a process that initiates the germination of the seed and then stops it at the optimal time. For making beer, that optimal time is when the germinating seed contains the most starches. That time is also when the very first indication of sprouting occurs. The seeds are then dried. The drying process is important for a couple reasons. Before the malted barley is used in a mash, it is milled. Milling cracks the seeds open to allow easy access to the starches inside. This is more easily done when the seed has been dried. But, drying also can change the flavor. Dark malts are malts that have been dried longer change flavor. When dried excessively long, chocolate and coffee-like flavors are brought out of the malt. Mashing uses water at the correct temperature to soften the milled seed and activate the enzymes it contains to turn those starches into sugars.

## Boiling

This sugary liquid, wort, is the basic building block of beer. But, brewers need to always be conscious of sanitation. The wort could contain unwanted wild yeast strains or bacteria. To remove these, the brewer boils the wort, usually for an hour or so. The boil is also the time when hops are added. Hops are also called the spice of the beer. The bitterness of the hops balances the sweetness of the malt. The addition of hops to the boil is somewhat debated among brewers. Lately, last minute hop additions have become more common. Also, there are two main types of hops, hops that for bittering and hops that for aroma. Bittering hops are typically added in the beginning of the boil. Aroma hops are typically added near the end. 

## Fermentation

Fermentation is the final step in brewing. It is the step where the brewer adds yeast to the wort. Temperature and wort quality are crucial to the fermentation step. The yeast cells ingest the sugars in the wort and produce two by-products, alcohol and co2. This process usually takes a few days to a week. Raising the temperature from an initial temperature help activate the yeast and allows them to cleanup left over by-products (called a Dactyl rest). For most beers, when this step is finished, the beer is ready to be carbonated and served.
